#### Title: An analysis of Ulimisana Optimisation for Malaria Control
##### Author: Mulenga Chipoka
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This research project presents the application of a recently developed AI-based Optimisation algorithm called Ulimisana to the Malaria Control problem. We formulate the OpenAI Gym Malaria Simulation platform as an objective function and solve the problem in a Contextual setting. Furthermore, the best parameter setting of Ulimisana was tested against a good setting of Genetic Algorithm, which we had set as the baseline model for this work.
